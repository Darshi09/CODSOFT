                <h2>The father of Indian mathematics</h2>
                <p>Aryabhata was an ancient Indian mathematician and astronomer born in 476 CE. He is renowned for his seminal work, the "Aryabhatiya," composed when he was 23 years old. Aryabhata made significant contributions to mathematics, including the introduction of the concept of zero, the place value system, and algorithms for extracting square and cube roots. In astronomy, he accurately calculated the Earth's circumference, explained the causes of solar and lunar eclipses, and proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. His work laid the foundation for future developments in both fields in India and influenced scholars in the Islamic Golden Age and Renaissance Europe.</p>
